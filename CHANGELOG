- All explorers
    - Instead of taking `initial_sequence_data`, explorers take one
    `starting_sequence` (suggestions on how to handle initial data appreciated!)
- Evaluation
    - Moved to `flexs.evaluate` and are now just a set of methods
    instead of a class

- DynaPPO
    - Now inherits from `flexs.Explorer`
    - Replaced `model_architectures` and `sequences_utils` with flexs versions
    - Changed `virtual_screen` to `model_queries_per_round`
    - Changed `self.model.evals` to `self.model.cost`
    - Now gets measured sequences from `measured_sequences["sequence"]` rather than `self.model.measured_sequences`
    - Environment
        - Swapped order of `seq_len` and `alphabet_len`
- AdaLead
    - Moved order of `initial_sequence_data` to be consistent with `flsd.Explorer`
- Sequence utils
    - Swapped one-hot indexing of `construct_mutant_from_sample` to be consistent with `(seq_len, alphabet_len)` shape of `string_to_one_hot`
- Testing
    - Added preliminary tests for AdaLead and DynaPPO
